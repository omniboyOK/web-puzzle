<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is a simple static website, just download and serve locally to modify with hot realoading

### Prerequisites

You don't need anything installed to try this locally but I recommend using serve.
* yarn
```sh
yarn global add serve
```

Once that's done, you can run this command inside your project's directory.
```sh
serve
```
